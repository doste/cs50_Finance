# cs50_Finance
 C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Very small and simple, written in Flask. It's one of the projects from the Harvard's CS50 online course.

As a database it uses a module from the CS50 course itself called just 'SQL' which works with a very lightweight SQLite3 database.

For the stock's data the app connects to [IEX API](https://iexcloud.io) 

As the frontend, it uses the ['Lux'](https://bootswatch.com/lux/) theme from Bootswatch

The app file has a lot of comments explaining what the code does, although they are in spanish.
